# Material definition for a dielectric bunny

newmtl DielectricBunny
# Ambient Color (often matches diffuse)
Ka 0.8 0.8 0.8
# Diffuse Color (base surface color - light grey for a clear dielectric)
Kd 0.8 0.8 0.8
# Specular Color (reflection color - typically white for dielectrics)
Ks 1.0 1.0 1.0
# Transmission Filter (color of light passing through - white for clear)
# Note: Some renderers might ignore Tf and rely solely on Kd and Ni for dielectrics.
Tf 1.0 1.0 1.0
# Emissive Color (set to black as it doesn't emit light)
Ke 0.0 0.0 0.0
# Index of Refraction (optical density)
Ni 1.5
# Specular Exponent (shininess - high for sharp dielectric reflections)
Ns 200
# Dissolve (Opacity - 1.0 is fully opaque. Refraction is handled by Ni and illum)
d 1.0
# Illumination Model (5 = Fresnel reflection and refraction, good for dielectrics)
illum 5
